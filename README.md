# Mouse Follow Animation

This is a small project I made to try out GSAP animations. The idea is simple:  
when you move your mouse over the screen, an image follows the cursor and also rotates a little based on the direction of movement.  

---

## What it does
- The image appears when you hover on the element  
- It follows your mouse smoothly  
- Thereâ€™s a subtle rotation that makes it feel more natural  

---

## Tech I used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- GSAP (for the animations)

---

## How to run
Just download/clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser.  
No extra setup needed.

---

## Future ideas
Might add:
- multiple images reacting differently  
- mobile/touch support  
- some more creative easing effects  

---

## Why I made this
Mostly for fun and practice with GSAP ðŸ˜….  
Also because I like adding small interactive effects to web pages.
